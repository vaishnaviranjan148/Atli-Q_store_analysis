# Atli-Q Store Analysis
## Project Summary
AtliQ Mart ran multiple promotional campaigns across 50+ stores in South India during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 festive seasons. The objective of this project was to analyze the effectiveness of these promotions and identify which offers, stores, categories, and products generated real business value.

This analysis focuses on incremental performance, measuring additional revenue and units sold due to promotions rather than total sales. The dashboard evaluates store-level performance, promotion type impact, category and product contribution, and campaign-wise comparison.

Key insights show that cashback-based promotions and combo categories delivered the highest incremental revenue, while flat discount offers like 25% OFF resulted in negative impact. The Diwali campaign significantly outperformed Sankranti, highlighting the importance of allocating higher budgets and better inventory planning for major festivals.

Overall, this project demonstrates how data-driven analysis can help retail businesses optimize promotional strategies, reduce value loss, and improve decision-making for future campaigns.

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights that promotional effectiveness varies significantly across offer types, categories, and campaigns. Cashback-based promotions, especially 500 Cashback, delivered the strongest incremental revenue, while flat discount offers such as 25% OFF resulted in value loss. Combo-based categories emerged as the highest contributors, indicating strong customer preference for bundled products.
